singleton desing pattern is an creational design pattern.

We use this pattern when we want to elimenate the option of instantiating more than one object of a particular class.

Here i am building a game in which the players are shared the same object of all the potential scrable letters and spits out new ones upon request. Each player share the same potential letter list and each player has his own lettr set.
